To use this Save Game Editor, simply put the .exe into the same folder as the LittleWitchNobeta.exe.
While this version of the Editor specifically was written for version 0.1106 Early Access, it will likely still mostly function after future updates.

Even things like future Areas should be supported, even when they are not directly in the list.

List of things that could maybe get added at a later time, which I just couldn't yet fully figure out:
- New Game + Toggle (Actually want)
- Time Stamp Editor (Doesn't sound interesting)
- Hot Save Feature: The Game saves, then reloads the save on loading Screens. Automated Hot Saves would be interesting, currently doing it manual works if your fast.
- Flags for Shortcuts and other Enviromental things. (Just a lot of work rly)

I do hope you enjoy the things you get with this Save Game Editor.




Everything able to be set within this Program was found using trial and error + thinking about what happened.
The Game itself was not tampered with during this progress.
